# Logility C# Coding Standards

## References

We generally want to follow the guidelines provided here:

* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/)

The standards specified below summarize the detailed Microsoft design guidelines. Where there are discrepancies, our guidelines take priority.

These standards are intended to apply to new C# solutions and projects, especially for the COBOL rewrite activities. Developers working on existing projects should generally keep the same conventions those projects use within those projects, but please consider opportunities to refactor existing code to use these conventions.
